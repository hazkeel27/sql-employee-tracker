## Description 📄

An employee tracker app with Node.js, leveraging the power of Inquirer, MySQL2, and Dotenv dependencies. This sophisticated application is designed to enable intuitive data interaction through a user-friendly interface.

Through Inquirer-powered prompts, users can intuitively create, read, update, and delete records within these tables. 

The MySQL2 library seamlessly bridges the gap between the app and the MySQL database, ensuring data integrity.

Dotenv is employed to securely manage sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials, away from the source code. This practice contributes to a more robust and secure architecture.

Built on modern ES6 concepts, the app employs smart coding practices to streamline processes. It effectively manages data across three interconnected tables: departments, employees, and roles. The integration of these components ensures both accurate data representation and efficient data manipulation.
